# AI Summarizer

I've created an AI summarizer powered by OpenAI's GPT-4 with some assistance of Adrian. It can take a URL as input and distill lengthy web articles into a single, coherent summary. This tool leverages GPT-4's advanced natural language understanding, making it effortless for users to obtain concise yet informative article summaries. It's a game-changer for staying informed in our fast-paced digital world.
